Tessellation in Spacetime is an ever evolving cellular automaton that was born on the unix epoch 1624204800 and changes its shape every 3 minutes. Everyone is seeing the same shape at the same time, it is a living thing that transcends your browser.  
Cellular automata are algorithms inspired by social evolution. Each cell depends on simple interactions with its neighbors to survive. Once in existence, the tessellation lives and evolves autonomously.

In this limited series of NFTs, each collector will receive a unique 3D printed object. Collecting will generate a unique 3D printed object of the tessellation at the moment of transaction. The blockchain does not only serve as a contract, but is a fundamental part of the projectâ€™s architecture. The medium is the message. 
The object inhabits the Tezos blockchain, which has a low carbon footprint. 

This is a joint project by Caroline Barrueco @ccaarroollliinnee and Pollinations @pollinations and was supported by the @mintfund Initiative.
